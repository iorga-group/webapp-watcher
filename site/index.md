Webapp Watcher (WAW) is a Java EE Filter which alows you to log the requests response times and Java stack traces of a Java EE web application (.war). You can later compute usage statistics of the web application, and also track down potential bugs with the tool "waw-analyzer".

Record, then analyze.
